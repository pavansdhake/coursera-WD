			Pav Bhaji
		</div>
		<p>
			Pav bhaji is a fast food dish from India. It consists of a thick vegetable curry served with a soft bread roll. Its origins are in the state of Maharashtra. Variants of the dish may use other bread varieties such as chappati, roti or brown bread. Pav Bhaji has its origins in the civil war of America in the 1860s. Because of the civil war, there was a huge demand for cotton. Due to this, the traders at the Bombay cotton exchange used to be very busy especially during the night when new cotton rates used to be telegram from America. Thus they used to return home late and the annoyed wives would not serve them food. So to solve this problem the street vendors to collect the leftover bread from the Jesuit priests and mix all the vegetables, mash them together and used to eat them with the bread and butter. Thus pav(bread) bhaji(vegetables) was born.
